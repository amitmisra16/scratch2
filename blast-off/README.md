# Blast-Off
<p>Blast-Off is scratch2 programming game tutorial that I created for my kids. The idea being to introduce basic game/programming concepts like branch conditions, loops, message passing between objects, detect collision between various game elements using [Scratch2](https://scratch.mit.edu/ "Scratch2 Homepage") platform.</p>

<p>The actual game development is divided into various stages. At the end of each stage we will have a game prototype which can be played. As we reach the final stages the game will be lot more fun and real. Having said that, in final stages will be adding lot more complex code than before. Once again plan to ease the learning experience with the mode of creating game and not to overwhelm with lot of theory.</p>

# Stages
## Stage 1: Basic Rocket movements
<p>In this very first stage we will simply add a rocket sprite to empty game and try to control its movements using arrow keys. This will introduce the key concept of infinite loops and interfacing with a player using keys.</p>

## Stage 2: Adding enemy airplane
<p>In this stage we will simply add an airplane sprite and make it move across the screen from left to right. This is not interesting at all, but introduce key concept around movements and trajectories in 2D space</p>

## Stage 3: Add firing capability to our Rocket
<p>If there is an enemy plane we should be able to shoot it down, right. This is exactly what we are going to do in this stage. We will create a missile sprite and make it shoot out from our rocket. In this stage we are going to see how states (x,y) coordinates can be passed across sprites, very much like throw-and-catch</p>

## Stage 4: Airplane burst on strike
<p>Final touches on last stage, if the missile touches enemy's airplane it should go down. Key concept here is to understand how various game sprites/pieces interacts with each other. In this stage we will add sound to our game, and play it when the enemy airplane goes down.</p>

## Stage 5: Keep track of the score
<p>Everyone wants to know at the end of the day how many enemy ships you shot down. In this stage we will see how we can add variables and keep track of scores</p>

## Stage 6:  Rocket burst on contact with airplane
<p>You might have seen our rocket and airplanes do not interact with each at all even when they make contact. This is against the laws of physics, when two bodies collide, well at least there should be a loud noise.</p>

## Stage 7: Airplane flight control
<p>In a real battle field enemy airplanes will not walk in line to be killed. They will sneak out form anywhere and fly in different directions. In this stage will see how we can make airplane sneak out from random positions. In this stage we will learn the concept of randomization.</p>

## Stage 8: Airplane retaliates
<p>It is not a fair game when you can strike your enemy down but they can't. To give them an equal chance we will add another missile sprite which the airplane can drop to strike our rocket down. If the enemy missile strike our rocket, it should meet the same fate as the airplane.</p>

## Stage 9: Attack of the clones
<p>You might have seen, your score does not exceed 1, because that many enemy airplanes we have. If you want to score more, we should spawn more enemy airplanes. In this this stage we will introduce the concept of cloning</p>

## Stage 10: Add new fire power
<p>Right now we have only one type of missile. In order to fight the clones sometimes that is not enough. We will add another missile which when fired will blow away all the clones. This missile will not be available all the time, you need to earn it.</p>

## Stage 11: Finishing touches - game screens and backgrounds
<p>Right now our game is very one dimensional, let's add background that can give us an illusion that we flying upwards. While we are at, we should also add backdrops for game entry and end screen</p>

## Stage 12: Finishing touches - Missile v/s missile

## Stage 12: Next level make is multi-player

## Stage 13: Next level keeping track of score
